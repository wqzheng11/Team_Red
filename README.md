Project Overview:
Develop a recommendation system that is based on the retail fashion brand's brand descriptive information.

The project includes 2 parts:
1. Build an NLP classification model to predict which brand a new product should be assigned.
2. Create a brand recommender algorithm that would recommend an outfit given a customer’s search query.
   - We tried both a TFIDF model and a Word2Vec model, and they are documented in TFIDF_Recommendation and Word2Vect_Recommendation files respectively
   - We included a section of future improvements on recommendation algorithm in the TFIDF_Recommendation file

Avaiable Data:
1. Behold Brands
2. Behold Products
3. Outfits and Items
4. Additional Tags
