    "### Future Improvements on the Model\n",
    "Based on test query #1 and #2, using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity should have given fairly accurate outfit recommendation given a customer's search query. However, there are still a few areas for future improvements on the model:\n",
    "1. Currently we can't test on our recommendation performance, so in the future we might develop some recommendation accuracy measures, which could be both quantitative (scores) and qualitative (customer surveys).\n",
    "2. Since we join the product data with outfit data, we might not make the most accurate product recommendation if the most desirable product doesn't exist in the outfit data. In the future, we could improve on this by either develop our own professional outfit recommendation rule/algorithm, or enrich the outfit combination database.\n",
    "3. As we notice, there could be multiple outfits associated with one product, and in our model, we only return the first outfit as default. But in the future, we could pick outfit combination in a smarter way. For example, we could prompt the user to reveal more preferences for their outfits in a following query."
